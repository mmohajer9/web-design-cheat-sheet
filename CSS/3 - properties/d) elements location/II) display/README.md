# About Displays

There are some elements that have `inline` display by default like :

1. `<img>`
2. `<span>`
3. `<strong>`
4. `<em>`

but almost every elements have the `block` display by default like :

1. `<div>`
2. `<h1>`
3. `<section>`
4. ...

**Tip : `inline` , `block` and `inline-block` are the main displays that elements use , there are also other displays that have their own special functionality**
