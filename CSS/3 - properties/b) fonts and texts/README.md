# Useful Notes on Fonts and Formats

for webpages we have 4 main types of fonts:

    1. eot (embedded-opentype)
    2. ttf (truetype)
    3. wof (woff)
    4. wof2 (woff2)

1. eot is only supported by microsoft browsers like IE but even not IE (Check [This](https://caniuse.com) Out).

2. ttf is developed by apple for developing post scripts and most of the browsers (except IE) support this format (Check [This](https://caniuse.com) Out) but it is used less in nowadays , because its font sizes are much bigger than the other 2 remaining types.

3. wof is developed by Mozilla in 2009 exclusively for Web Development and it is supported by almost all of the browsers (except IE :\ ).

4. wof2 is developed again by Mozilla and it is like a version 2 of wof format and it is well-compressed and its file sizes are much lower than wof , just look at the image down here

in CSS we have 2 values of font-family that we can use :

   1. Generics that indicates the group of fonts that we can use (e.g. : serif) and serif can contain a lot of other fonts in every computer. you can check the generic fonts here : [Here]([https://link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family))

   2. Direct Font Family (non generic)

why we have 2 values for font-family ?

    because whenever the first one was not founded , then it applies the second one and its a generic and it sure it will be available
